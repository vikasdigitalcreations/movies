## Update Notification & Self-Update Modals

When a new release is detected, a centered modal card displays the version comparison, environment instructions, release highlights, and quick actions:

- `u` / `U`: Download and install update immediately (direct binary replacement platforms).
- `b` / `B`: Copy Homebrew upgrade command (`brew upgrade moviebox-tui`) to clipboard with status toast on Homebrew-managed installations.
- `o` / `O`: Open GitHub release notes in the system browser.
- `Esc`: Dismiss modal and return to previous screen.
- The notification modal formats release notes into clean, indented category sections (`[Added]`, `[Fixed]`) with bold feature titles and bullet items, stripping decorative prefixes and duplicate paragraph text.
- During self-update (`u`), a focused progress modal displays an active spinner with a unified action status (`⠋ Downloading MovieBox-Tui v...` / `⠋ Installing MovieBox-Tui v...`) and a cross-platform warning notice (`⚠ Please wait • do not close terminal` on modern terminals, `[!] Please wait - do not close terminal` on basic terminals) with generous border clearances.
- Modal presentation is deferred while actively typing in the search bar (`InputMode::Editing`) to prevent input hijacking. During update installation, keyboard and mouse inputs are locked while the progress modal is displayed.
## Wide-Terminal Grid

On terminals at least 110 columns wide, search results render in two
columns (three at 160+). `↑`/`↓` move one visual row, `←`/`→` move one
item, and clicks map through column bounds. Narrower terminals keep the
classic single-column list where `←`/`→` jump a full page.
