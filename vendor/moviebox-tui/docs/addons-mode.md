# Stremio Addons Provider (HTTP Addons)

Stremio Addons are integrated directly into standard Streaming Mode as a first-class content provider alongside MovieBox, 4KHDHub, and BDIX mirrors. You can install any standard addon manifest URL to fetch metadata catalogs and aggregate direct HTTP/HTTPS media streams.

## Features

- **Standard Protocol Support**: Compatibility with standard addon manifests (`/manifest.json`, `/catalog`, `/meta`, `/stream`).
- **Core Metadata Protection & Fast Resolution**: Cinemeta is pre-installed out-of-the-box as the core metadata provider (`[Core]`) and locked to prevent accidental removal. Metadata requests prioritize media type resolution with full support for alternate crew fields (`directors`, `writers`, `stars`).
- **Direct HTTP Stream Engine**: Automatically extracts and filters direct Cloudflare R2, PixelDrain, direct video CDN, and HubCloud/HubDrive HTTP streams.
- **Multi-Addon Concurrency**: Simultaneously queries all enabled stream addons and aggregates releases.
- **Quality, Resolution & Codec Parsing**: Ranks streams with high-contrast color-coded resolution badges (`4K UHD`, `1080p FHD`, `720p HD`, `SD`) and granular audio/video codec tags (`HDR`, `DV`, `ATMOS`, `5.1`, `HEVC`, `AV1`, `BluRay`, `WEB-DL`, `REMUX`), file size in GB/MB, and audio language tracks (e.g. `[Dual]`, `[Multi]`, `Hindi + English`).
- **Series & Episode Hierarchy**: Series are automatically organized into explicit `Seasons` and `Episodes` selector panes (including Season 0 Specials) with smooth horizontal navigation (`←`/`→`/`h`/`l`/`Tab`). Selecting any episode drives episode-specific stream requests (`/stream/series/:id:season:episode.json`).
- **Episode Stream Isolation**: Built-in token parsing (`parse_season_episode`) guarantees that only streams matching the selected season and episode are displayed, eliminating cross-episode stream mixing.
- **Direct Playback & Custom Headers**: Video stream headers (`behaviorHints.headers`) such as `Referer` and `User-Agent` are preserved and forwarded directly to external media players (`mpv`, `IINA`, `VLC`) and the multi-segment downloader.
- **Watch History & Progress Parity**: Full `/history` support for Addon streams with real-time `mpv` position tracking, scrub lines, and auto-resume.
- **High-Performance Caching**: Curated `/browse` catalogs are cached for `1 hour`, manifests for `24 hours`, and stream aggregations for `2 hours`.

## Accessing Addon Streams

- `Ctrl+P`: Cycle providers in Streaming Mode to select **Addons**.
- `/config`: Open the **Addon Manager** directly when the active provider is `Addons`.
- `Tab` or click `[Addons]`: Open the **Addon Manager** popup directly from the search bar.
- `Ctrl+S`: Return smoothly to **MovieBox** provider.
- `/browse`: Browse curated addon catalogs (`Top Movies`, `Top Series`, `Top Rated Movies`, `Top Rated Series`).

## Addon Manager

- Interactive modal anchored in place of the landing search bar, displaying installed addons and activation state.
- `✓` / blank indent: Toggle addon enabled/disabled state (`Enter` or `Space`). Core provider remains protected with instant notice.
- `+ Add manifest URL`: Install any public HTTP addon manifest by URL.
- `d` or `Delete`: Remove the selected addon (protected for core metadata provider).
## Persistence

Installed addons are atomically saved to `addons_config.json` inside the application config directory (`~/Library/Application Support/moviebox-tui/` on macOS, `~/.config/moviebox-tui/` on Linux, `%APPDATA%\moviebox-tui\` on Windows). If `addons_config.json` encounters corrupt data on disk, it is preserved and rotated to `addons_config.json.corrupt.{timestamp}` before initializing fallback defaults, preventing silent data loss.
